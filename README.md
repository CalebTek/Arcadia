## **Repository Description**

> **Arcadia** is a modular ASP.NET Core demo application designed to practice and showcase clean architecture principles.
> It follows a multi-layered structure with **API**, **Application**, **Infrastructure**, and **Domain** layers, plus a dedicated **Test** layer for unit and integration testing.
> Built for learning, it includes real-world patterns, SOLID principles, dependency injection, and testing strategies — making it an ideal playground for improving .NET development skills.

# Arcadia – Clean Architecture Demo in ASP.NET Core

Arcadia is a modular, educational ASP.NET Core application designed to help developers
practice clean architecture concepts and sharpen their skills.

## Architecture Overview
- **API Layer** – HTTP endpoints, filters, middlewares
- **Application Layer** – Use cases, CQRS, interfaces, DTOs
- **Infrastructure Layer** – Data persistence, external integrations, EF Core
- **Domain Layer** – Core business entities, value objects, domain events
- **Test Layer** – Unit & integration tests

## Key Features
- Follows **Clean Architecture** principles
- Fully modular & testable
- Demonstrates **CQRS**, **MediatR**, and repository patterns
- Ready-to-extend with real-world use cases

> **Tip:** This repo is a playground. Add features, break things, refactor, and learn.

If you want, I can **design the initial ASP.NET Core solution template** with all these layers pre-wired, including basic dependency injection, EF Core setup, and testing projects so you can start coding right away. That way, you can just clone it and start adding functionalities.

Do you want me to prepare that starter solution?
